# Changelog

## amorem 1.0.0

First CRAN release, under the name **amorem**. The package was renamed
from the working name `amore`, which collided (case-insensitively) with
the archived CRAN package `AMORE`. This release consolidates the 0.9.0
development line into the first stable, installable version: the unified
[`rem()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/rem.md)
front-end (the `clogit`, `gam`, and `nn` backends, including the
additive-spline architecture), the Gillespie / tau-leap simulation
engine, the endogenous-statistics catalogue, and the martingale-residual
goodness-of-fit family. Relative to 0.9.0 the package was renamed to
**amorem** and the exported feature functions dropped their `compute_`
prefix — `compute_endogenous_features()` and
`compute_hyperedge_features()` became
[`endogenous_features()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/endogenous_features.md)
and
[`hyperedge_features()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/hyperedge_features.md);
the rest of the API is unchanged.

## amorem 0.9.0

New neural backend and a small number of API refinements; the version
intended for the first CRAN release.

- **STREAM-style additive splines:**
  `nn_control(architecture = "additive_spline", batch_strata = )` fits
  per-covariate B-spline effects by (mini-batch) stochastic gradient on
  the exact case-control partial likelihood — the construction of
  Filippi-Mazzola & Wit (2024, JRSS-C, <doi:10.1093/jrsssc/qlae023>) —
  giving interpretable additive smooth curves on the same objective as
  `clogit`, with mini-batching for large event logs.
- **New `rem(method = "nn")` backend:** a multilayer perceptron scores
  every candidate in a case-control stratum and is trained on the
  conditional-logistic partial likelihood (softmax over each risk set) —
  a nonlinear, prediction-oriented counterpart of `clogit`. Pure-R
  implementation (no extra dependencies), configured via
  [`nn_control()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/nn_control.md);
  [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) reports in-sample
  (and, with a validation split, held-out) concordance and
  `plot(type = "pdp")` shows per-feature partial-dependence curves.
- **API:** the degenerate-logistic backend is now `method = "gam"` (was
  `"degenerate"`); the smooth-term wrappers are `tv()` / `nl()` /
  `tvnl()` (was `tve()` / `nle()` / `tvnle()`); `re()` is unchanged.
- [`rem()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/rem.md)’s
  `case` argument now defaults to `NULL` and is taken from the formula’s
  left-hand side (e.g. `event ~ x`) for the `clogit`/`nn` backends.
- [`widen_case_control()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/widen_case_control.md)
  auto-detects the 0/1 indicator column (`event` or `IS_OBSERVED`) when
  `case` is not given.
- [`widen_case_control()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/widen_case_control.md)
  now carries the sender/receiver identifiers of the case and its
  matched control into the output (`sender_ev`/`receiver_ev`/
  `sender_nv`/`receiver_nv`); the new `keep_ids` argument controls this
  (default `TRUE`). The dyads behind each pair are no longer lost, and
  `re()` grouping terms can reach the actor levels
  ([\#92](https://github.com/franciscorichter/amorem/issues/92)).
- `rem(method = "gam")` now detects long-format case-control input (a
  `event`/`IS_OBSERVED` indicator with control rows) and widens it with
  [`widen_case_control()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/widen_case_control.md)
  before fitting, emitting a message — instead of silently misreading
  raw per-row values as event-minus-control differences
  ([\#93](https://github.com/franciscorichter/amorem/issues/93)).
- `compute_endogenous_features()` gains a `prior_log` argument for
  warm-starting the network state from events that precede the study
  window: its rows update the running state but never appear in the
  output, separating warm-starting from the non-event masking role of
  `history_log`
  ([\#94](https://github.com/franciscorichter/amorem/issues/94)).
- [`cpp_supported_stats()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/cpp_supported_stats.md)
  is now exported.

## amorem 0.1.0

First release.

- [`rem()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/rem.md)
  unified fitter for preprocessed case-control data, with a `gam`
  (case-1-control logistic via
  [`mgcv::gam()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mgcv/man/gam.html)) and a `clogit`
  backend.
- Smooth-term formula wrappers for the `gam` backend (time-varying,
  non-linear, time-varying-non-linear) and an `re()` grouping random
  effect; `re()` reproduces the Intro-to-REM tutorial parameterization,
  and
  [`rem()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/rem.md)
  exposes a `gam_method` argument.
- Simulation via
  [`simulate_relational_events()`](https://franciscorichter.github.io/amorem/reference/simulate_relational_events.md)
  (Gillespie and tau-leap), the endogenous-statistic feature engine,
  non-event sampling, and the martingale-residual goodness-of-fit
  family.
